# Graph-Analytics-Project
This repository contains the code to reproduce a course project. This course is Graph Analytics offered by [Ariful Azad](https://arifulazad.com/) who is a very helpful and reliable professor. The title of my project is *Semi-supervised Community Detection with Graph
Convolutional Networks*. In this project, I explored community detection models in real-world networks based on modularity matrix and graph convolutional networks(GCn). If you would like to know more about this report, please refer to my project report which is also in this repo.
